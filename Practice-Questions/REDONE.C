/* You have become good friends with Chef. Right now, Chef is busy in the kitchen, so he asked you to solve a problem for him.

Consider a list of integers L
. Initially, L contains the integers 1 through N, each of them exactly once (but it may contain multiple copies of some integers later). The order of elements in L is not important. You should perform the following operation N−1

times:

    Choose two elements of the list, let's denote them by X

and Y
. These two elements may be equal.
Erase the chosen elements from L
.
Append the number X+Y+X⋅Y
to L

    .

At the end, L
contains exactly one integer. Find the maximum possible value of this integer. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007 (109+7).
